# Development Workflow

## Change Management
- All changes require:
  1. CHANGELOG.md update using Keep a Changelog format
  2. Documentation updates in /docs for public APIs
  3. ADR for significant architectural decisions in docs/adr/

## Version Control
- Keep commits in Conventional Commit style
- Respect minimal-diff principle; modify only code requested

## Code Quality
- Never push code that produces pylint > 8.0 or flake8 errors > 0
- Format with Black; follow PEP 8 strictly

## Process
- Always propose tests in tests/ before changing src/
- Limit self-generated follow-up prompts to 3; then request human input
