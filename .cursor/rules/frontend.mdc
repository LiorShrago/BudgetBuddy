# Frontend Standards

## JavaScript
- Place JS in static/js directory
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains for asynchronous code
- Organize code in modules when complexity increases
- Use Webpack/esbuild for JavaScript module bundling in production
- All production code should be minified

## CSS
- Tailwind CSS is preferred when available
- Otherwise, use BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Organize CSS by component or feature
- Avoid inline styles in HTML
- Prefer CSS variables for theming and repeated values
- Ensure responsive design with appropriate media queries

## Performance
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Lazy-load resources when possible
- Optimize image sizes and use responsive images
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Bundle and minify assets for production
