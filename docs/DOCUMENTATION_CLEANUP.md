## Old Files to Remove

Once the changes are verified, the following files can be removed:

- `CHANGELOG.md` (root directory)
- `CHANGELOG_BudgetBuddy.md` (root directory)
- `development_notes.md` (root directory)
- `debug_checklist.md` (root directory)
- `tests/README_QUICK_START.md`

## Next Steps

1. Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Create additional documentation as needed:
   - Installation guide (`docs/installation.md`)
   - User guide (`docs/user_guide.md`)
   - API documentation (`docs/api/`)
3. Implement a documentation maintenance process
4. Consider using a documentation generator for API documentation
