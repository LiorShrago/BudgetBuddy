# Context7 Compatibility Guide

This document outlines considerations for ensuring our documentation structure is compatible with Context7, a code indexing and search tool.

## Context7 Overview

Context7 is a tool that indexes code and documentation to provide intelligent search and navigation capabilities. It relies on file structure, links between files, and proper Markdown formatting to build its index.

## Compatibility Checklist

Our reorganized documentation structure has been designed with Context7 compatibility in mind:

- [x] Used standard Markdown format for all documentation files
- [x] Created proper directory structure with logical organization
- [x] Used relative links between documentation files
- [x] Maintained consistent heading structure
- [x] Preserved code blocks with proper language syntax highlighting
- [x] Created a central README.md file as an entry point
- [x] Used semantic file naming (e.g., DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md instead of dev-notes.md)

## Additional Context7 Considerations

When Context7 indexes our documentation, it will benefit from:

1. **Consistent Headers**: All documents use H1 (#) for titles and H2 (##) for major sections
2. **Internal Linking**: Documents link to each other using relative paths
3. **Table of Contents**: Most documents include a table of contents with anchor links
4. **Code Examples**: Properly formatted with language identifiers for syntax highlighting
5. **Logical Structure**: Files are organized in a way that mirrors their relationship

## Git History Preservation

Context7 can benefit from preserved git history, which provides additional context about when and why changes were made. By following the steps in GIT_HISTORY_PRESERVATION.md, we ensure that Context7 has access to the complete history of our documentation files.

## Future Improvements for Context7 Compatibility

To further enhance Context7 compatibility:

1. **Add Tags**: Consider adding standardized tags to documentation files
2. **Create Index Files**: Add index.md files in each subdirectory
3. **Use Frontmatter**: Add YAML frontmatter to markdown files with metadata
4. **Add Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams can be used to visualize architecture
5. **Consistent Terminology**: Ensure consistent use of technical terms across docs

## Verification

To verify Context7 compatibility:

1. Check that all links between documents work correctly
2. Ensure that the documentation renders properly in markdown previewers
3. Verify that code blocks are correctly highlighted
4. Test the documentation structure with Context7 indexing
5. Confirm that the git history is preserved for all moved files
