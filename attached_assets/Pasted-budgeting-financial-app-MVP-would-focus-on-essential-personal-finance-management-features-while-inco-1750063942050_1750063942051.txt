budgeting financial app MVP would focus on essential personal finance management features while incorporating advanced CSV transaction handling capabilities. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the core features and the enhanced CSV functionality using Python, Jinja, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.

Core MVP Features
Registration and Account Creation
The app requires secure user registration with personal data entry and robust authentication mechanisms. Users create accounts to begin tracking their spending, with security features including two-factor authentication, fingerprint recognition, and unique code generation.

Account Synchronization
Users can synchronize various financial accounts including credit cards, debit cards, investments, and loans. This synchronization allows users to view all account information in one centralized location for effective budget tracking.

Budgeting and Expense Categorization
The system provides budgeting options for weekly, monthly, or multi-month planning periods. Users can set spending limits with notifications before overspending occurs. The app includes categories and subcategories for expenses - for example, under "Home" there are subcategories like "Mortgage and Rent" and "Furnishings". Mint automatically categorizes transactions and displays them as visual charts showing spending distribution.

Transaction Management
Users can view individual spending categories and access every expense under each category. The system supports transaction splitting for purchases containing multiple categories, such as buying groceries, clothing, and household items in a single store visit. Transaction rules can be created for automatic categorization - once configured, these help assign correct categories to specific vendors automatically.

Filtering and Search Capabilities
The base system allows filtering by account types and specific accounts, with the ability to view only transactions associated with selected criteria. Users can sort transactions by date, description, category, and amount in ascending or descending order.

Enhanced CSV Upload and Processing Features
CSV File Upload Interface
Users can upload CSV files containing transaction data through a web interface built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The upload component would handle file validation and provide real-time feedback on file format compatibility.

CSV Parsing and Column Mapping
The Python backend processes uploaded CSV files using pandas or similar libraries. During import, users map CSV columns (Date, Description, Amount, etc.) to the application's standard transaction fields. The system handles various date formats (converting to mm/dd/yyyy format) and processes description fields by removing special characters that could cause parsing errors.

Intelligent Categorization Engine
After parsing, transactions undergo automatic categorization using merchant names or keywords in transaction descriptions. The system creates categorization rules that can be applied to future transactions from the same vendors. Users can manually override categories and create custom categories as needed.

Advanced Filtering System
The enhanced filtering system allows users to:

Filter by Category: View all transactions within specific spending categories like "Dining Out" or "Transportation"

Filter by Account: Isolate transactions from individual financial accounts (specific credit cards, checking, or savings accounts)

Nested Filtering: Filter by account within categories, such as viewing all "Visa Credit Card" transactions categorized as "Travel"

Multiple Criteria: Combine filters by date range, transaction type, tags, or review status

Technical Implementation Stack
Backend (Python)
The server-side logic handles CSV processing using pandas for data manipulation and parsing. SQL queries filter and retrieve transaction data based on user criteria. The database schema includes tables for users, accounts, transactions, categories, and transaction rules.

Database (SQL)
The database structure supports multi-currency transactions across multiple bank accounts. Key tables include:

Users and account management

Transaction storage with category assignments

Budget templates and monthly budget tracking

Category and subcategory definitions

Transaction rules for automatic categorization

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
JavaScript handles dynamic filtering interfaces, allowing users to apply multiple criteria without page reloads. The interface provides real-time budget tracking with visual indicators showing spending against set limits. CSV upload forms include drag-and-drop functionality and progress indicators.

Template Engine (Jinja)
Jinja templates render dynamic content based on filtered transaction data, displaying categorized transactions and budget summaries. Templates handle conditional rendering for different account types and category views, ensuring responsive layouts across devices.

CSV Processing Workflow
The system validates uploaded files, maps columns to database fields, processes transactions through the categorization engine, and updates the transaction database. Error handling manages invalid data formats and provides user feedback for correction. The workflow includes duplicate detection to prevent data inconsistencies.

This implementation creates a comprehensive budgeting application that combines Mint's core functionality with enhanced CSV processing capabilities, providing users with flexible transaction management and detailed financial insights through robust filtering and categorization systems
