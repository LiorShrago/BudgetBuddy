“I’m redesigning my BudgetBuddy dashboard to follow Mint’s information hierarchy.

DELETE the three statistic tiles now labelled Total Balance, Active Accounts, and This Month that appear across the top of the dashboard.

REPLACE them with five equal-width statistic cards, left-to-right: Net Worth, Credit Cards, Cash, Loans, Investments.

Each card displays a large dollar figure (default $0.00) and a small subtitle with the account type.

Apply colour cues similar to Mint: green for positive balances, red for negative.

INTERACTIVITY

Make every statistic card clickable.

When clicked, the card reveals a small dropdown menu (or collapsible panel) that lists up to three highest-value items for that category (e.g., top three credit-card balances).

Each dropdown item is clickable and routes to (or opens) a detailed view for that individual account/holding.

Use lightweight UI patterns so the page remains uncluttered.

LAYOUT & RESPONSIVENESS

Keep the existing “Spending Breakdown by Category” and “Recent Transactions” panels exactly where they are—do not alter their structure or styling.

Ensure the five cards stay in a single row on screens ≥ 768 px and stack two-per-row below that breakpoint.

STYLING (dark theme)

Background #121417, card background #1E2227, text #FFFFFF at 90 % opacity.

Icons must continue loading from the Feather set.

SCOPE CONTROL

Only modify code directly related to:
– removing the old three tiles,
– adding the five new statistic cards,
– implementing the dropdown menus,
– styling & responsiveness for those additions.

Do NOT change any other components, routes, build configs, or global styles.

CHANGE-LOG REQUIREMENT

Create (if it doesn’t exist) or append to a file named CHANGELOG_BudgetBuddy.md.

For every edit you make, write a bullet entry that states the file(s) changed, a one-line summary of the change, and the timestamp.

Before making any new modification, read this file first and ensure you are not duplicating previous work.

OUTPUT

Prepend a concise bullet list of all files touched, including CHANGELOG_BudgetBuddy.md.

Return only the updated or newly created code blocks.

No additional commentary.”
